# Azure Resource Management Tools - Progress

## What Works

The Azure Resource Management Tools currently have the following functional components:

1. **Resource Discovery**:
   - ✅ KeyVault discovery with tenant ID extraction
   - ✅ Service Bus discovery with tenant ID extraction
   - ✅ Fallback to generic resource discovery when type-specific APIs have permission issues
   - ✅ Resource group filtering based on naming patterns
   - ✅ Comprehensive logging of discovered resources

2. **Resource Matching**:
   - ✅ Tenant ID extraction from resource names
   - ✅ Flexible regex patterns to handle naming variations
   - ✅ Web app matching based on tenant ID
   - ✅ Target resource group identification

3. **Resource Management**:
   - ✅ Dry-run mode for testing without actual changes
   - ✅ PowerShell-based resource movement for reliability
   - ✅ PowerShell-based access policy management for reliability
   - ✅ Error handling for all operations
   - ✅ Detailed result reporting

4. **Command Line Interface**:
   - ✅ Command arguments processing
   - ✅ Support for flags like --dry-run and --verbose
   - ✅ Menu-based interactive mode
   - ✅ Consistent command framework

5. **Logging System**:
   - ✅ Multi-level logging (Information, Warning, Error, Success, Verbose)
   - ✅ Color-coded console output
   - ✅ Context-aware logging
   - ✅ Detailed operation reporting

## Current Status

### Azure Resource Mover

The Resource Mover application is **functional** and can:

- Authenticate with Azure
- List available subscriptions
- Discover resources in source resource groups
- Match resources to their corresponding web apps
- Identify target resource groups
- Execute resource moves (or simulate them in dry-run mode)
- Report results with detailed information

The core code modifications we've made include:

1. Enhanced resource discovery methods in `AzureResourceService` to use generic resource enumeration as a fallback
2. Improved regex patterns to handle naming variations
3. Added comprehensive logging throughout the discovery and movement process

### Azure DevOps Release Agent Pool Updater

The Release Agent Pool Updater script is **functional** and can:

- Authenticate with Azure DevOps using Azure AD
- Find release definitions matching the pattern "iqon-sticos-{tenantId}"
- Extract tenant IDs from release definition names
- Update the Agent Pool to "Iqon Sticos VMSS 2" for matching releases
- Support filtering by specific tenant ID
- Execute in dry-run mode to preview changes without applying them
- Provide detailed logging of all operations

The implementation includes:

1. `AzureDevOpsService` using REST APIs to interact with Azure DevOps
2. `ReleaseAgentPoolUpdaterScript` to orchestrate the update process
3. Command line interface with options matching the existing structure
4. Integration with the existing logging and authentication framework

### Azure Key Vault Access Policy Updater

The Key Vault Access Policy Updater script is **functional** and can:

- Authenticate with Azure
- Discover key vaults across resource groups matching "rg-iqon-sticos(-\d+)?"
- Find key vaults matching the pattern "kv-iqonsticos{tenantId}"
- Filter key vaults by specific tenant ID
- Add access policies with configurable permission levels
- Execute in dry-run mode to preview changes without applying them
- Provide detailed logging of all operations

The implementation includes:

1. `KeyVaultAccessPolicyScript` to orchestrate the discovery and update process
2. PowerShell command integration for reliable access policy updates
3. Configurable access levels (SecretsReadOnly, SecretsReadWrite, CertificatesReadOnly, KeysReadOnly, FullAccess)
4. Command line interface with options matching the existing structure
5. Integration with the existing logging and authentication framework

## Known Issues

1. **Permission Dependencies**:
   - The application requires appropriate permissions to read resources and execute operations
   - Some environments may have role-based access control (RBAC) restrictions that limit discovery or operations

2. **Resource Dependencies**:
   - Some Azure resources have dependencies that may prevent movement
   - Currently, the application reports errors but doesn't automatically resolve dependencies

3. **Partial Operations**:
   - If an error occurs during operations on multiple resources, there's no automatic rollback
   - Resources that were successfully processed before an error remain in the modified state

4. **Limited Resource Types**:
   - Resource Mover currently only supports KeyVaults and Service Buses
   - Other resource types that might be left behind are not yet handled

## What's Left to Build

1. **Additional Resource Types**:
   - Add support for other resource types (e.g., Storage Accounts, SQL Servers)
   - Implement appropriate discovery methods and regex patterns for each

2. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Add pre-operation dependency analysis
   - Implement dependency resolution or ordering

3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Implement parallel resource discovery for better performance
   - Add parallel operation options with appropriate safeguards

4. **Rollback Mechanism**:
   - Design and implement rollback capability for failed operations
   - Add transaction-like behavior for multi-resource operations

5. **Enhanced Reporting**:
   - Add export options for discovered resources (e.g., CSV, JSON)
   - Implement detailed reporting of operations
   - Add visualization of resource relationships

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Test the current implementation with different Azure environments
2. Gather feedback on usability and effectiveness
3. Address any critical bugs or issues
4. Begin implementing support for additional resource types
5. Consider adding dependency analysis as a priority enhancement

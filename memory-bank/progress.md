# Azure Resource Mover - Progress

## What Works

The Azure Resource Mover application currently has the following functional components:

1. **Resource Discovery**:
   - ✅ KeyVault discovery with tenant ID extraction
   - ✅ Service Bus discovery with tenant ID extraction
   - ✅ Fallback to generic resource discovery when type-specific APIs have permission issues
   - ✅ Comprehensive logging of discovered resources

2. **Resource Matching**:
   - ✅ Tenant ID extraction from resource names
   - ✅ Flexible regex patterns to handle naming variations
   - ✅ Web app matching based on tenant ID
   - ✅ Target resource group identification

3. **Resource Movement**:
   - ✅ Dry-run mode for testing without actual changes
   - ✅ PowerShell-based resource movement for reliability
   - ✅ Error handling for movement operations
   - ✅ Movement result reporting

4. **Command Line Interface**:
   - ✅ Command arguments processing
   - ✅ Support for flags like --dry-run and --verbose
   - ✅ Menu-based interactive mode
   - ✅ Consistent command framework

5. **Logging System**:
   - ✅ Multi-level logging (Information, Warning, Error, Success, Verbose)
   - ✅ Color-coded console output
   - ✅ Context-aware logging
   - ✅ Detailed operation reporting

## Current Status

The application is **functional** and can:

- Authenticate with Azure
- List available subscriptions
- Discover resources in source resource groups
- Match resources to their corresponding web apps
- Identify target resource groups
- Execute resource moves (or simulate them in dry-run mode)
- Report results with detailed information

The core code modifications we've made include:

1. Enhanced resource discovery methods in `AzureResourceService` to use generic resource enumeration as a fallback
2. Improved regex patterns to handle naming variations
3. Added comprehensive logging throughout the discovery and movement process

## Known Issues

1. **Permission Dependencies**:
   - The application requires appropriate permissions to read resources and execute moves
   - Some environments may have role-based access control (RBAC) restrictions that limit discovery or movement

2. **Resource Dependencies**:
   - Some Azure resources have dependencies that may prevent movement
   - Currently, the application reports errors but doesn't automatically resolve dependencies

3. **Partial Moves**:
   - If an error occurs during movement of multiple resources, there's no automatic rollback
   - Resources that were successfully moved before an error remain moved

4. **Limited Resource Types**:
   - Currently only supports KeyVaults and Service Buses
   - Other resource types that might be left behind are not yet handled

## What's Left to Build

1. **Additional Resource Types**:
   - Add support for other resource types (e.g., Storage Accounts, SQL Servers)
   - Implement appropriate discovery methods and regex patterns for each

2. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Add pre-move dependency analysis
   - Implement dependency resolution or ordering

3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Implement parallel resource discovery for better performance
   - Add parallel movement options with appropriate safeguards

4. **Rollback Mechanism**:
   - Design and implement rollback capability for failed moves
   - Add transaction-like behavior for multi-resource moves

5. **Enhanced Reporting**:
   - Add export options for discovered resources (e.g., CSV, JSON)
   - Implement detailed reporting of move operations
   - Add visualization of resource relationships

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Test the current implementation with different Azure environments
2. Gather feedback on usability and effectiveness
3. Address any critical bugs or issues
4. Begin implementing support for additional resource types
5. Consider adding dependency analysis as a priority enhancement
